### An installer for the fantastic [Firefox GNOME Theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme) by [Rafael Mardojai CM](https://www.mardojai.com/)

This is a utility to automatically install the Firefox GNOME Theme and keep it up

### Final Notes:
* [Troubleshooting FAQ](https://github.com/largestgithubuseronearth/addwater/blob/main/docs/troubleshooting.md)
* A few options are not supported in Add Water due to them being finicky or buggy but you can see a list of all options [here](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme?tab=readme-ov-file#features).
